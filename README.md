carbonapi: replacement graphite API server
------------------------------------------

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dgryski/carbonapi.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dgryski/carbonapi)

CarbonAPI supports a significant subset of graphite functions [see [COMPATIBILITY](COMPATIBILITY.md)].
In our testing it has shown to be 5x-10x faster than requesting data from graphite-web.

To use this, you must have a [carbonzipper](https://github.com/dgryski/carbonzipper)
install, which in turn requires that your
carbon stores are running [go-carbon](https://github.com/lomik/go-carbon) (Note: you need to enable carbonserver in go-carbon)

It's possible to talk directly with `go-carbon`'s carbonserver module, but custom `/info` handler won't work.

The only required parameter is the path to a config file. For an example see `carbonapi.example.yaml`

$ ./carbonapi -config /etc/carbonapi.yaml

Request metrics will be dumped to graphite if coresponding config options are set,
or if the GRAPHITEHOST/GRAPHITEPORT environment variables are found.

Request data will be stored in memory (default) or in memcache.

OSX Build Notes
---------------
Some additional steps may be needed to build carbonapi with cairo rendering on MacOSX.

Install cairo:

$ brew install Caskroom/cask/xquartz

$ brew install cairo --with-x11

Set `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` and `-tags cairo` when building:

`$ PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/opt/X11/lib/pkgconfig go build -v -tags cairo`
